bio: |
  Imran Siddique is a Principal Group Engineering Manager at Microsoft with over 15 years of experience driving scalable innovation. He is the author of "Architecting at Scale" (Packt Publishing) and a thought leader in **Agent Control Planes** and **Context Engineering**.
  
  His engineering philosophy, **"Scale by Subtraction,"** challenges leaders to remove complexity to achieve reliability. Imran writes extensively on the shift from static software to self-evolving agentic architectures, focusing on "The Mute Agent" pattern and temporal knowledge graphs.

# Learn with Imran Siddique

Welcome to my learning corner! I focus on the intersection of distributed systems and Agentic AI, helping engineering leaders and architects build production-grade systems that survive the hype cycle.

## 🧠 Core Concepts
My work defines the following architectural pillars for the AI era:
* **Scale by Subtraction:** The senior engineering discipline of deleting complexity to increase velocity.
* **Agent Control Planes:** Governance layers that act as "Semantic Firewalls" for autonomous systems.
* **Context Engineering:** Moving beyond flat RAG to multi-dimensional, temporal Knowledge Graphs.

## 📚 curated Learning Paths

I organize my writing into deep-dive series. Choose a path below to start learning:

### **Path 1: Context Engineering**
*A technical deep-dive into the "Memory" of AI systems. Why RAG fails without time-awareness and how to fix it.*
* **Part 1: The Architecture of Recall** - *Foundations of high-fidelity retrieval.*
* **Part 2: The Temporal Index** - *Why your AI needs to understand "when" as much as "what."*
* **Part 3: The Frugal Architect** - *Managing token economics in massive context windows.*

### **Path 2: The Agentic Architect**
*Blueprints for building autonomous agents that are safe, reliable, and production-ready.*
* **Part 1: Large Reasoning Models & Inference Costs**
* **Part 2: The Semantic Firewall & Agentic RAG**
* **Part 3: Multi-Agent Systems & Headless Agents**
* **Part 4: Self-Healing Systems & Cognitive Architecture**

### **Path 3: Scale by Subtraction**
*Engineering leadership philosophy for the AI era.*
* **Scale by Subtraction: An Engineering Leader's View on Practical AI**
* **Part 2: Redefining the Engineering Organization**
* **Part 3: The Economics of AI Product Strategy**
* **Why Senior Engineers Must Be “Chief Deletion Officers”**

### **Selected Essays**
* **[The Mute Agent: Why Your AI Needs to Shut Up and Listen to the Graph](https://dev.to/mosiddi/the-mute-agent-why-your-ai-needs-to-shut-up-and-listen-to-the-graph-1j60)** *My core thesis on constraining AI agents using graph-based logic to eliminate hallucinations.*
* **[The End of the Text Box](https://dev.to/mosiddi/the-end-of-the-text-box-architecting-the-universal-signal-bus-for-ai-4740)** *Why the future of AI interfaces is polymorphic and multi-modal.*
