summary: |
  Imran Siddique is a **Principal Group Engineering Manager at Microsoft** and the author of *"Architecting at Scale"* (Packt Publishing). 
  
  His engineering philosophy, **"Scale by Subtraction,"** challenges leaders to remove complexity to achieve true reliability. Imran is a thought leader in **Agent Control Planes**, focusing on the governance, safety, and architectural constraints of autonomous AI systems. He actively writes about Context Engineering, the "Mute Agent" pattern, and the shift from static software to self-evolving agentic architectures.
