    summary: Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nate Herk. Iâ€™m passionate about helping small businesses unlock the power of AI Automations to save time, cut costs, and stay competitive. I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2024, and then started working full time as a business intelligence analyst where I worked in automation. This experience opened my eyes to the power of automation, so I threw myself into how I could use artificial intelligence to make automations even smarter and faster. Now, I create content on YouTube where I teach others how to leverage AI in order to help them scale their businesses, without any coding experience! Letâ€™s build a more efficient future together!
