# Welcome to Microsoft Learn Community Content!

Ready to learn something new? Curious about how something works? All content in this area is written and maintained by experts in our Microsoft Learn community!

We're just getting this experience off the ground, but we hope that it can help you gain the skills you're looking for by providing you options to learn from people just like you, who have demonstrated expertise in specific subjects and want to share what they know. Content is provided by [Microsoft MVPs](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) and invited community experts who clearly have a passion for helping people learn. 

**Want to know more about who you're learning from?** Author names, linked to their Microsoft Learn profiles, are listed near the top of the article. If you find someone's content helpful, drop them a note by providing feedback!

**Want to become an author?** At this time, we are only inviting a small set of authors to participate. If you're interested, [we'd love to hear from you](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/dU8RNdzL7w), but we'd also encourage you to explore the [many other ways you can share your expertise on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute)!
